# Phishing Email Detection Using Ensemble Learning

This project presents a **phishing email detection methodology** that combines **Ensemble Learning** with **hybrid features** (content-based and textual) to improve detection accuracy. It utilizes **Stacking** and **Soft Voting** ensemble methods to process features separately in parallel, reducing complexity and enhancing performance. The proposed model achieves an **F1-score of 0.9942** on a large, imbalanced dataset of phishing and benign emails.

## 🔥 Key Features
- **Hybrid Feature Extraction**: Combines content-based and textual features for better phishing detection.
- **Ensemble Learning**: Uses Stacking and Soft Voting to enhance model accuracy.
- **High Performance**: Achieves an **F1-score of 0.9942**, outperforming traditional models.
- **Google Colab Support**: Easy-to-run Python notebooks for experimentation.
- **Rich Dataset**: Trained on a dataset with **32,051 benign** and **3,460 phishing** emails.
